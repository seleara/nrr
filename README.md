# NewRockRaiders

NewRockRaiders (NRR) is a game engine with the goal of allowing one to play Rock Raiders on modern systems at arbitrary resolutions, as well as hopefully making modding easier in the future.

## Setup

First, you need to copy the files `LegoRR0.wad` and `LegoRR1.wad`, as well as the `AVI` and `Sounds` folders from your original Rock Raiders game folder and paste them into the `NewRockRaiders/data` folder.
Then, while using `NewRockRaiders/` as the working directory, run `NewRockRaiders.exe`.
